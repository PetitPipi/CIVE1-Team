## Tips

1. Always start a new conversation when the previous context is no longer needed, otherwise it costs more and more as the conversation gets longer.
2. You can share a conversation with team members by copying the thread ID. However, be cautiousâ€”anyone with the ID can delete the thread from the system.   
3. The file search widget displays only the 20 most recent files. Files uploaded here will become part of the model's shared knowledge base, accessible to all users. If you don't want your file to be included, please remember to delete it after completing your query.
